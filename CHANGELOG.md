# Changelog

All notable changes to Kadr will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Transition engine** wired through `CompositionBuilder`:
  - `Transition.fade(duration:)` — fade-through-black; clips do not overlap
  - `Transition.dissolve(duration:)` — cross-blend; clips overlap by `duration`
  - `Transition.slide(direction:duration:)` — slide via `CGAffineTransform` ramp; supports `.fromLeft`, `.fromRight`, `.fromTop`, `.fromBottom`
  - All transitions overlay correctly with audio crossfades on overlapping clip audio
- **Speed control**: `VideoClip.speed(_ rate: Double)` — `0.25...4.0`. Audio pitch is preserved (`AVAssetExportSession.audioTimePitchAlgorithm = .spectral`).
- **Audio ducking**: `AudioTrack.ducking(_ targetVolume: Double)` — auto-lowers the music track's volume while clip audio is playing (100 ms ramp window).
- **Typed errors**: `KadrError.invalidTransition`, `.invalidSpeed`, `.invalidDuckingLevel` for export-time validation.

### Changed

- `Transition.fade` semantics: previously implemented as a cross-fade (overlapping clips with opposing opacity ramps). Now means **fade-through-black**, matching standard editing terminology. The previous behavior is available as `Transition.dissolve`. Since v0.1.0-alpha never wired transitions through the engine, no exported behavior is broken.
- Test suite grew from 48 → 80 tests (transitions, speed, ducking).

### Fixed

- CI: bundled `Tests/KadrTests/Resources/sample.mov` re-encoded to 540p/10s. The previous 4K source caused decode failures on the GitHub `macos-15` runner.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Result-builder DSL with `Video { ... }` syntax
- `ImageClip` for static image to video conversion
- `VideoClip` for existing video file manipulation
- `AudioTrack` with `.volume(_:)`, `.fadeIn(_:)`, `.fadeOut(_:)` modifiers
- Clip modifiers: `.trimmed(to:)`, `.reversed()`, `.muted()`, `.withAudio(_:)`
- Export presets: `.reelsAndShorts`, `.tiktok`, `.square`, `.cinema`, `.custom(...)`
- H.264 and HEVC codec support
- `Exporter` class with `AsyncThrowingStream<ExportProgress, Error>` for progress tracking
- `ExportProgress.estimatedTimeRemaining` time estimation
- `Exporter.cancel()` for cancelling in-progress exports
- `VideoClip.thumbnail(at:)` for frame extraction
- `VideoClip.metadata` for reading duration, resolution, frame rate
- `Transition` type (API defined, engine implementation deferred to v0.2)
- Typed errors via `KadrError`
- Platform type aliases (`PlatformImage`, `PlatformColor`) for cross-platform support
- SimpleEditor sample app
- 48 tests covering DSL, export, and API validation
